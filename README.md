# Women Safety SOS App

## Overview
This project demonstrates concepts and ideas related to women’s safety by implementing an SOS system that can alert friends and family in case of an emergency. The app utilizes a combination of sound (SOS sound) and flashing lights to grab the attention of people nearby.
